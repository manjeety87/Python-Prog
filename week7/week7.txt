When we create objects from classes, it is called instantiation
The object we create is known as instance of a instance.
The variable does not always store the instance it often stores the reference to the instance.
A reference is just a fancy word for an address.
Refernces matter when we talk about making copies of variables / object 
Shallow copy -> is the same address (and so references same object) 
Deep copy -> Is a new object at a new address. If we create a deep copy of object it creates new instance.
          -> Deep copies often have to nest by making deep copies of attributes.


Nouns are attributes
Verbs are methods
    -> functions are like methods but they don't require a object to be called on.

Attributes thay cann be modified after an object is instantiated are known as "Mutables"
