Types in Python

Pyhton variables can change type based on the data we place in them 
num1 = 4
print(type(num1))
num1 = num1/2 #now num1 is changed to type float
print(type(num1))


-> When a variable changes types, we call this "casting"
-> When a type is changed as a side effect of an operation we call this implicit casting.
-> When we use code yo change the a typeourselves we call this explicit casting.
-> The explicit operators are int(), float() & str()
-> with integers all the numbers after deicmals are truncated ex. 2.999999 is 2 only the remaining .99999 is truncated
