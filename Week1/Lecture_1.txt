1. Case matters
"m" is not M -> python is case sensitive
print("") is not "Print()"

2. Brackets() signify functions -> function are links to another blocks of code that perform a function.
    -> If a function requires additional information we can pass "agruments" as "parameters".

When we call a print() function -> print("Hello World") is a string.
    -> Where print() is a function and "Hello World" is a argument

If a fucntion accepts multiple arguments, we seperate them with a comma operator

Q. Print the strings "Hello" and "World" using a single print() statement
Ans. print("Hello" , "World")


3. Operators follow the same precedence as in normal maths i.e BEDMAS(Brackets, Exponential, Divide, Multiply, Addition, Subtraction)
